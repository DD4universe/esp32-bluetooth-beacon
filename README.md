# ESP32 Bluetooth Beacon ðŸš€

This project transforms an **ESP32** into a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon** (iBeacon/Eddystone) â€” using only the ESP32 and a USB cable. No external sensors or wiring required.  

With this code, your ESP32 continuously broadcasts BLE advertisement packets that can be detected by any smartphone using a free BLE scanner app.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Works with **any ESP32 Dev board**  
- No external components required (just USB power)  
- Broadcasts as an **iBeacon** with customizable UUID, Major, and Minor values  
- Detectable on iOS and Android using BLE scanner apps  
- Super lightweight â†’ runs forever in low-power mode

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Open Arduino IDE  
2. Select **ESP32 Dev Module** as your board  
3. Select the correct **Port** (after installing USB drivers if needed)  
4. Upload the code to ESP32  
5. Open **Serial Monitor (115200 baud)** â†’ you should see:  
6. Open the BLE scanner app on your phone â†’ scan for beacons â†’ your ESP32 should appear!

## âœ¨ Customization
You can change the UUID, Major, and Minor values in the code:  
```cpp
#define BEACON_UUID "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0"
oBeacon.setMajor(1);
oBeacon.setMinor(1);
